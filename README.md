# Database-Management-Systems-Project
This project was completed as part of the “Database Management Systems” course during my Bachelor’s studies at the Lebanese American University. The goal was to design and then implement a database for a hospital management system.

Project Components: 

1) Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): 
- Designed to visually represent the entities and their relationships.

2) Relational Schema: 
- Translated the ERD into a relational schema, which serves as a blueprint of how tables, columns, and relationships are organized in a database.

3) Data Dictionary:
- Documented all tables, columns, data types, and constraints.

4) Implementation in PostgreSQL: 
- The relational schema was translated into SQL code in PostgreSQL.
